## Description 

This password generator was developed as a way to generate a strong password that provides greater security. Before clicking the generate password button you are prompted with settings that give you the ability to confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.

## Technologies Used 
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Future Development 

In the future I hope to make the password criteria settings pull up in a modal window.
