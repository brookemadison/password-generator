## Description 

This password generator was developed as a way to generate a strong password that provides greater security. Before clicking the generate password button you are prompted with settings that give you the ability to confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.


In this project I used HTML and CSS and JavaScript.

In the future I hope to make the password criteria serttings pull up in a modal window.
